# /*          Problem Code: CBSPEED
# Contest Code:START41
# Problem
#         In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of XX bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at YY bits per second, is he prone to errors?
#         If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.
#         Input Format
#         The only line of input contains two space separated integers X and Y — the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.
#         Output Format
#         If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.
#         You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, Yes, yEs, and YES will all be treated as identical).
